Tech Launchers is a program to go the extra mile beyond the regular mentor and mentee program. This is something, I had always planned to do and passionate about but did not get the right platform to champion. Through JavaScript and Friends, I am excited to launch this program in 2020.

There is always a gap which regular coursework at college or bootcamp do not teach or self-taught programmers do not learn. Tech Launchers are those who will fill that gap.

### Why did I name the program as "Launchers"?

The most common words we get to imagine on hearing the term Launcher is either a Rocket Launcher, Satellite Launcher or Launch Vehicle. 

Based on Wikipedia - 

> A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket propelled vehicle used to carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond.


> A rocket launcher is a device that launches an unguided, rocket-propelled projectile

Now that you have a basic understanding of the term "Launcher", Tech Launchers are those who will have both qualities in them.  



### Who are Tech Launchers?

Tech Launchers are those who will guide and support college/bootcamp graduates and self-taught programmer's to unleash their potential. Launchers will propel and boost college/bootcamp graduates and self-taught programmer's path to tech industry by offering support via knowledge, network, referrals and help them close the gaps making them job ready.

Tech Launchers will advise, coach and be there as support providing feedback to college/bootcamp graduates and self-taught programmer's. You can go an extra mile and be available to them until they reach their destination.

As a Tech Launcher, you can choose to launch as many as you want. 


### How much time should I dedicate to be Tech Launcher?

The program is initially targeted for 14 days with a minimum overall time commitment of 10 hours. You can also go the extra mile by extending the program beyond 14 days.


### How do I connect and communicate with Students?

As moderator of the program, I will share with you details of students who are looking for Tech Launchers. 

You can connect with them through JavaScript and Friends Slack channel "techlaunchers" initially and then choose either of the following preferred modes - email, chat, voice calls based on your preference. 
Check the links section below for joining the Slack channel.

You will define the rules on when you want to connect and the frequency.


### Final Thoughts

I will refine the program as we start. Let us close the gap. 

Why should our future aspiring programmers reinvent the wheel?

I am in as a Tech Launcher and excited to launch as many as I can this new year. If you are interested in joining me in this journey, you can reach out to me for more details. 

This is a voluntary initiative to help. The program enforces JavaScript and Friends "Code of Conduct".

Share the details of this program to as many college/bootcamp graduates and self-taught programmers as you can.
